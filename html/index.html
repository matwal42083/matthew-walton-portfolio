              I’m Matthew Walton, I also use the screen name or username matwal042083. You can pretty much find me almost everywhere
              online under this screen name or username. I’m a Fullstack Engineer from Springfield Missouri. I attended Fullstack
              Academy and graduated in October 2023. I didn’t start looking for a job right away because I felt that I needed to 
              learn more, lots more. So I’ve been learning and teaching myself on freeCodeCamp and Codeacademy. I’ve learned a 
              lot from Fullstack Academy but I still feel that I need to learn more. I know that I’m going to be consistently 
              learning new things as I advance throughout my whole career. I’ve learned a lot about computers throughout my childhood 
              in the 80’s and 90’s. I was 6 years old, the first time I started playing around with computers. 
              My grandpa just bought one and was very excited about it. My grandpa was the one who encouraged me to learn 
              them. So he made a point to teach me. Back in those days, there was no Windows OS. Only MS-Dos OS, which was a 
              operating system in the 80s and it was kind of a pain in the ass. It was a command-line interface system, So I started 
              on CLI to operate, run programs, and navigate file systems on a computer. Just to run a simple program, you had 
              to commend and tell it what to do. Then Windows came out and was most recommended to have Windows on your computer, so 
              my grandpa got it. One day my grandpa told me that I needed to learn a lot about computers and to become an IT professional 
              because he told me when I grew up that, everybody would have a computer and everyone would be carrying a handheld computer. 
              I looked at him like he was crazy. I stated “Why”, he stated “You just don’t understand, You're too young to even comprehend 
              this. But this will be important to you, for everything. One day, that's how you're going to be able to apply for a job, rent 
              a house buy one request deliveries, taxi rides, or order food at a restaurant. About damn ner everything”. At the time, I didn’t 
              take him seriously. Until 2006, when the first iPhone commerce came out. I was wowed by that, It was a big wholly shit moment for me, 
              because this was told to me by my grandpa. For a long time, I thought that he was just jerking my chain about it. Today is 2025 and now 
              I fully believe him. He would be impressed by everything that’s out now. I was a teenager when the internet came out for the first 
              time. I was excited about it. These were the days of the Netscape. Which was an internet browser and service provider as well. Then 
              AOL came out, It was a service provider and a browser as well. I was a big user of Napster, the shared music files system. Back then, 
              guys like me looked up to Sean Parker and Sean Fanning. Two 19-year-old childhood friends who grew up together, and later on built Napster. 
              Napster was very impressive back then. There was nothing like it. It was a shared music file system, which means that your sharing music with 
              other people. It starts with someone uploading files to the system, then someone else searches for the music then downloads it. Then more people 
              upload more music files with a wider range. Every time you search for music, it looks for the closest computer that has it, and then it returns 
              a list of all the closest to farthest of that one particular song, artist, or album depending on what you searched. Each item on the 
              list has the song title, artist name, duration of the song, album title, the location of the computer it’s on, how long to download it, 
              then a progress bar for download progress, then there was a way to tell if the song or whatever it was, if its safe, secure and not a 
              virus. The bad part about Napster is that you had to be careful, very careful. Because you're actually at risk of accidentally downloading 
              a virus. That was the first thing you had to check for, if it was safe and secure, one wrong move and it was a bad day for anybody that didn’t 
              pay attention. Nowadays I use Spotify to collect my music files and create playlists. I continued to play around with computers until I was 16 
              years old and even built my first computer and worked with it in my computer class in high school. Then one day, I just stopped. This is one big 
              regret, that I have in my life. I started to feel that I was being watched, because of a certain occurs. One time, I walked away from my computer 
              and went back to it and saw that my mouse was moving across my screen when no one was doing it, so I thought. There were other things as well. I 
              have never worked in the IT industry, I’ve worked in the restaurant industry for about five years working at various restaurants as a line cook, 
              pre-cook, bus table, host, and serve tables. I’ve worked as a houseman at the hotel once and liked it. I worked in the medical field for about 18 
              years as a CNA, and CMT. I was a Certified Nursing Assistant and a Certified Med Tech, For the last 6 years of my medical career, I was a BHT behavioral 
              health Tech working with troubled teenagers. Then I started working at Amazon in 2021 at the STL3 fulfillment center in Brookline Missouri. Then I learned 
              about the Career Choice program at Amazon. So I decided to get back into IT, and by this point, I had serious thoughts about it. Then I made my decision about 
              it. I remember that I was really into Web Development back in the day.
            </p>
            
            <p class="bio-content">
              I then started to get a head start and I was shocked to find that there was a lot of 
              information out there about Web Development. I found the learning platforms and started to teach myself how to code. I started with HTML 5 and flew through 
              it fast, CSS 3 was the same until I started doing JavaScript. At first learning JavaScript, I was lost and the platform that I was on didn’t teach it very 
              well. I didn’t even know how to do anything on the terminal for a minute, Now I do. Now I know how to deal with the terminal and mess around with it. I didn’t 
              know Git or Github that well and now I do. I have sharpened my CLI commands, Git, GitHub, JavaScript, and much more. My dreams are to master JavaScript and Java, 
              SQL, PHP, React, Vue, Angular, TypeScript and Devvit by Reddit. I want my first developer job, to be with a good company that has a team to work with and learn 
              more from, I want to be able to grow my soft and hard skills with this company and become a Master Fullstack Engineer. 
              I want to build cross-platform websites and apps that are cross-platform with each other. I also want to learn about 
              Security, Data engineering, Network engineering, computer administration, and more for extracurricular activities. 
              I have collected a lot of certifications and want to do the COMP TIA+, Security, Data, Networking, and for Development 
              Certifications.
